        <h1>Thanks For Your Interest!</h1>
        <p>Due to the fact that I've shown this AMAZING FOOD APP to many potential investors, and I want to protect my idea and IP, and to prevent people to take the idea or get their own ideas on how to build an AMAZING FOOD APP like that, I decided to move it to a diifferent url because it's better safe than sorry...<br/><br/>Dear potential investors, if you like what you've seen, and want to continue the "business conversations" and maybe to have your chance to be part of this brilliant and HUGE opportunity, please contact <a href="mailto:avi@restful.co.il">Avi Assayag</a>, or +972-50-7606660<br/><br/>Thanks and have a beautiful day :)</p>
